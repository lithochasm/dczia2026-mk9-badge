DCZia Presents: The MK9 Badge

It blinks. It types. You can wear it around your neck and then set it on your desk and actually use it\*.

\* _Desk productivity not guaranteed. DCZia assumes no responsibility for keys accidentally sent during badge parties. Consult your keyboard layer documentation before operating heavy machinery._

## About

The **MK9** is a fully functional **3×3 mechanical macropad badge**. Nine real mechanical switches, per-key RGB lighting, ambient underglow, an accelerometer that actually does something interesting, SAO support, and CircuitPython firmware out of the box — all in a package sized to hang around your neck at DEF CON and survive the week.

---

## Specs

**Keys**
- 9× mechanical switches in a 3×3 grid — standard MX footprint, swap keycaps as you please
- Ships with translucent blue keycaps
- Full N-key rollover USB HID keyboard when plugged into a computer

**Lighting**
- 9× WS2812B per-key RGB LEDs — one under each switch
- 6× SK6812 side-firing LEDs — edge-mounted for ambient underglow out the sides

**Brains & Sensors**
- RP2040 microcontroller
- 3-axis accelerometer — tilt-reactive lighting, shake to change patterns
- 2× SAO connectors (standard 6-pin, I2C + 2 GPIO each) — expand with the badge add-on ecosystem

**Power & I/O**
- USB-C — power and data
- 3× AAA battery pack — run it untethered
- Power switch for battery mode
- Reset button + BOOTSEL button for easy firmware flashing

**Firmware**
- Ships with CircuitPython firmware
- QMK-compatible hardware — reflash and run it as a full QMK macropad

## What It Does Out of the Box

On boot: a rainbow diagonal wipe sweeps across the keys and backlights. Any keypress skips it.

Once running:
- Background light patterns cycle across all 15 LEDs — rainbow wave, breathing pulse, or sparkle
- Pressing a key sends a colour ripple expanding outward from that key through all the LEDs
- Tilt the badge to shift the colour palette; shake it to switch patterns
- Plug into a computer and it shows up as a numpad (7–9 / 4–6 / 1–3 layout)

## Programming / Updating

The badge runs [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org). To update the firmware:

1. Hold **BOOTSEL** while plugging the badge into your computer — it mounts as `RPI-RP2`.
2. Drag the CircuitPython `.uf2` onto the drive. It reboots as `CIRCUITPY`.
3. Copy the `lib/` folder contents to `CIRCUITPY/lib/` (see [software/README.md](software/README.md) for the library list).
4. Copy all `.py` files from `software/` to the root of `CIRCUITPY`.

The badge restarts automatically. If it gets into a weird state, delete everything on `CIRCUITPY` and start fresh — it won't brick.

Want to run QMK instead? The hardware is fully compatible; QMK setup instructions will be posted separately.

**Recommended IDEs:** Visual Studio Code with the [CircuitPython extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python), or [Thonny](https://thonny.org). A Commodore 64 with a serial adapter also works but is left as an exercise for the reader.
